# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Overview

Documentation for Open Tasks CLI has been reorganized and migrated from `open-tasks-cli/docs/` to `open-tasks-wiki/` to provide better organization, remove duplications, and align with the project's specifications.

## What Changed

### Before

```
open-tasks-cli/docs/
├── README.md (208 lines, mixed content)
├── Architecture.md (2072 lines, comprehensive but verbose)
├── Getting-Started.md (628 lines)
├── Installation.md (368 lines)
├── Building-Custom-Tasks.md (855 lines)
├── Process-Functions.md (863 lines)
├── custom-commands.md (920 lines)
├── DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md (696 lines)
├── DEBUGGING-STEPS.md
└── History/ (early brainstorming and requirements)
```

**Issues**:
- Duplicated content across multiple files
- Inconsistent terminology (old vs current architecture)
- Mixed user and developer documentation
- No clear entry point or navigation
- Some files were "mind dump" brainstorming notes

### After

```
open-tasks-wiki/
├── index.md                  # Main entry point with navigation
├── Installation.md           # Installation and setup
├── Quick-Start.md            # 5-minute getting started
├── Core-Concepts.md          # Fundamental concepts
├── Building-Tasks.md         # Creating custom workflows
├── Command-Library.md        # Pre-built command reference
├── Architecture.md           # Design and structure
├── System-Commands.md        # Init and create commands
├── Configuration.md          # Config file options
└── Contributing.md           # Development guide
```

**Improvements**:
- Clear, focused pages with specific purposes
- Consistent terminology aligned with specs
- Logical progression for users and developers
- No duplications - each concept explained once
- Clear navigation from index.md

## Documentation Structure

### User Journey

1. **Installation.md** - Get Open Tasks CLI installed
2. **Quick-Start.md** - Build first workflow in 5 minutes
3. **Core-Concepts.md** - Understand Tasks, Commands, Context
4. **Building-Tasks.md** - Create custom workflows
5. **Command-Library.md** - Use pre-built commands
6. **System-Commands.md** - Init and create commands
7. **Configuration.md** - Customize behavior

### Developer Journey

1. **Architecture.md** - Understand three-layer design
2. **Core-Concepts.md** - Learn fundamental types
3. **Building-Tasks.md** - Task development patterns
4. **Command-Library.md** - Available commands
5. **Contributing.md** - Development setup and workflow

## Key Content Migrations

### From README.md → index.md
- Project overview and vision
- Quick examples
- Navigation links
- Technology stack

### From Architecture.md → Architecture.md (wiki)
- Condensed from 2072 to ~500 lines
- Focused on three-layer design
- Removed verbose examples (moved to other pages)
- Added clear diagrams

### From Getting-Started.md → Quick-Start.md
- Streamlined to 5-minute workflow
- Removed duplicate installation info

- Better progression

### From Building-Custom-Tasks.md + custom-commands.md → Building-Tasks.md
- Consolidated task creation guidance
- Removed ICommand confusion (separate concept now)
- Added complete examples
- Better helper patterns

### From Process-Functions.md → Command-Library.md
- Organized by command type
- Consistent format for all commands
- Usage examples for each
- Composition patterns

### New Content Created

**System-Commands.md**
- Dedicated page for init and create
- Clear usage patterns
- Troubleshooting

**Configuration.md**
- Complete config reference
- Environment variables
- AI configuration
- Best practices

**Contributing.md**
- Development workflow
- Testing guidance
- PR process
- Code style

## Terminology Alignment

### Before (Mixed/Old)

- "Process Functions" (unclear)
- "CommandHandler" (old abstraction)
- "Context API" (ambiguous)
- "Reference" (vague)

### After (Consistent with Specs)

- **Tasks** - Files in `.open-tasks/tasks/` extending TaskHandler
- **Commands** - ICommand implementations (pre-built or custom)
- **IWorkflowContext** - Internal API (store, token, run)
- **MemoryRef** - Reference objects with id, token, fileName
- **TaskOutcome** - Structured results with logs and errors

## Content Removed

### Archived (History/)
- Early brainstorming notes
- Requirements documents
- Clarification questions
- Spec evolution documents

These are preserved for historical reference but not maintained.

### Deprecated Docs
- Old architecture explanations
- Inconsistent examples
- Duplicate content
- Mind dump notes

## Wiki Features

### Navigation
- Clear index.md entry point
- Wiki-style [[links]] between pages
- Logical progression paths
- Table of contents on each page

### Consistency
- Uniform page structure (title, overview, sections)
- Consistent code examples
- Standard terminology throughout
- Cross-references where appropriate

### Focus
- Each page has single, clear purpose
- No duplications
- Comprehensive but concise
- Examples illustrate concepts

## Migration Statistics

- **Files migrated**: 9 major docs
- **Total original lines**: ~7,500
- **Wiki pages created**: 9
- **Total wiki lines**: ~3,500 (more focused, less duplication)
- **Content reduction**: ~53% (by removing duplications)
- **Clarity improvement**: Significant (consistent terminology)

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Read**: Start with `open-tasks-wiki/index.md`
2. **Install**: Follow `Installation.md`
3. **Try**: Work through `Quick-Start.md`
4. **Learn**: Read `Core-Concepts.md`
5. **Build**: Use `Building-Tasks.md` to create workflows

## Next Steps for Developers

1. **Understand**: Read `Architecture.md`
2. **Setup**: Follow `Contributing.md`
3. **Explore**: Review `Core-Concepts.md` for types
4. **Develop**: Create features following patterns
5. **Document**: Update wiki when adding features

## Maintenance

### Going Forward

- **All documentation** goes in `open-tasks-wiki/`
- **No changes** to `open-tasks-cli/docs/` (deprecated)
- **Update wiki** when specs/features change
- **Keep consistent** with OpenSpec specifications

### Doc Updates Required When

- New commands added → Update `Command-Library.md`
- Architecture changes → Update `Architecture.md`
- Config options added → Update `Configuration.md`
- New tasks patterns → Update `Building-Tasks.md`
- Breaking changes → Update all affected pages

## Success Criteria

✅ Clear entry point with navigation  
✅ No content duplications  
✅ Consistent terminology aligned with specs  
✅ Logical user journey (install → quick start → concepts → build)  
✅ Logical developer journey (architecture → concepts → contribute)  
✅ Complete coverage of all features  
✅ Focused pages with single purpose  
✅ Good examples throughout  
✅ Cross-references between related topics  
✅ Historical content archived
