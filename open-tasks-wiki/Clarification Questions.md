Before I create the OpenSpec proposal, I need to clarify a few details about the npm-based tool:

1. **Tool Name**: What should the npm package be called? (e.g., `open-tasks-cli`, `task-cmd`, etc.)
> `open-tasks-cli` is good.

2. **Command Execution Model**: The requirements mention:
    
    - "CMD with verbs to express different properties"
    - "verb routes to a named class for async processes"
    - Should each verb be a separate command (e.g., `open-tasks store <args>`, `open-tasks replace <args>`) or subcommands?
    > no the process is made up of these subcommands.  allowing the values to store the context that can be explicitly passed around.
      
3. **Extension/Plugin System**: The requirements state "I should be able to quickly add a new command module to the directory I am working in under `.open-task/command-verb`"
    > `open-tasks`
    > 
    - Should this be `.open-tasks/` (plural) or `.open-task/` (singular)?
    - Should the tool auto-discover and load custom command modules from this directory? yes
    - What language should custom commands be written in (JS/TS)?  Yes, JS or TypeScript.
4. **Built-in Commands**: From the vision example, I see these operations:
    > Updated the list.
    - `store` - save value to memory
    - `load` - load file content
    - `replace` - string replacement with template
    - `powershell` - execute PowerShell commands
    - `ai-cli` - AI CLI call with context - should be configurable and support common cli commands.
    - `extract` - regex extraction
    
    Should all of these be implemented initially all, and each of them should have an option argument to pass a "token" for the replace calls.
    
5. **AI Integration**: The "codex" command suggests AI integration. Should this:
    -  this is not specific to Codex, the ai-cli call should require a special class with the configuration for how to call the CLI (the cli is expected to already be authenticated. )
      
6. **Output Format**: Requirements mention "output files" and "screen for user observation"
    
    - Should all async operations automatically write to files in a specific directory?
    - What naming convention for output files?  if a token is given, the token and a timestamp, and if no token is given each ref should have a UUID, use that with the timestamp.
      the timestamp should be first, so that you can see the order in which files are created.
