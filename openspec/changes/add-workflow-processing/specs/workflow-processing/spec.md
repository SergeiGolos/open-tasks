# Workflow Processing Specification

**Capability ID:** `workflow-processing`  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Draft

## Overview

The Workflow Processing capability provides a context-based system for executing asynchronous processes with automatic file-based input/output recording. It enables storing values, loading from files, applying transforms, and running commands with file references that can be passed between operations.

---

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Context Object Initialization

The system MUST provide a WorkflowContext object that manages all workflow operations.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Create workflow context with default settings

**Given** a user wants to execute a workflow  
**When** the user creates a new WorkflowContext instance  
**Then** the context should be initialized with default output directory  
**And** the context should be ready to accept store, load, transform, and run operations

#### Scenario: Create workflow context with custom output directory

**Given** a user wants to specify a custom output location  
**When** the user creates a WorkflowContext with outputDir option  
**Then** the context should use the specified output directory for all file operations  
**And** the directory should be created if it doesn't exist

---

### Requirement: Store Operation

The context MUST provide a store method that saves arguments as text files with automatic naming.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Store string value with automatic naming

**Given** a WorkflowContext is initialized  
**When** the user calls `context.store("Hello World", "greeting")`  
**Then** a file should be created with name `greeting.{timestamp}.md`  
**And** the file should contain the text "Hello World"  
**And** a FileReference should be returned pointing to the created file

#### Scenario: Store value with custom property name

**Given** a WorkflowContext is initialized  
**When** the user calls `context.store("data", "myProperty")`  
**Then** a file named `myProperty.{timestamp}.md` should be created  
**And** the content should be "data"  
**And** the returned FileReference should have property name "myProperty"

#### Scenario: Store multiple values with same property name

**Given** a WorkflowContext is initialized  
**When** the user calls store with the same property name twice  
**Then** each call should create a file with a different timestamp  
**And** both files should exist with unique names  
**And** each should return its own FileReference

#### Scenario: Store with optional file name transform

**Given** a WorkflowContext is initialized  
**When** the user calls store with a custom file name transform  
**Then** the generated file name should be modified by the transform  
**And** the file should be created with the transformed name

---

### Requirement: Load Operation

The context MUST provide a load method that reads file content and creates a FileReference.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Load file by file name

**Given** a file `data.txt` exists with content "Test Data"  
**When** the user calls `context.load("data.txt")`  
**Then** the file content should be read  
**And** a FileReference should be created with timestamp in the name  
**And** the reference should contain the file content "Test Data"

#### Scenario: Load file that does not exist

**Given** a file `missing.txt` does not exist  
**When** the user calls `context.load("missing.txt")`  
**Then** an error should be thrown  
**And** the error should indicate the file was not found

#### Scenario: Load with optional file name transform

**Given** a file exists  
**When** the user calls load with a custom file name transform  
**Then** the returned FileReference should have a transformed file name  
**And** the content should be loaded correctly

---

### Requirement: Transform Operation

The context MUST provide a transform method that applies operations on memory elements.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Apply single transform to reference

**Given** a FileReference contains "Hello {{name}}"  
**And** a token replacement transform is configured with name="World"  
**When** the user calls `context.transform(reference, [tokenTransform])`  
**Then** a new file should be created with content "Hello World"  
**And** the file name should include `.transform.` in the name  
**And** a FileReference should be returned pointing to the new file

#### Scenario: Apply multiple transforms in sequence

**Given** a FileReference contains "Value: 123 and 456"  
**And** two transforms are configured: regex extraction and token replacement  
**When** the user calls `context.transform(reference, [transform1, transform2])`  
**Then** transforms should be applied in order  
**And** the output file should contain the final transformed content  
**And** a FileReference should be returned

#### Scenario: Store transform metadata with output

**Given** a transform operation is performed  
**When** the output file is created  
**Then** the file should include metadata about applied transforms  
**And** the metadata should list transform types and parameters  
**And** the metadata should preserve the original content

#### Scenario: Apply transform with optional file name transform

**Given** a transform operation with file name transform is requested  
**When** the user calls transform with custom file name transform  
**Then** the output file name should be customized by the transform  
**And** the transformed content should be stored correctly

---

### Requirement: Run Operation

The context MUST provide a run method that executes ICommand instances.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Execute command with context

**Given** a class implementing ICommand interface exists  
**When** the user calls `context.run(commandInstance)`  
**Then** the command's execute method should be called with the context  
**And** the command should execute asynchronously  
**And** a FileReference should be returned from the command execution

#### Scenario: Pass arguments to command execution

**Given** a command accepts additional arguments  
**When** the user calls `context.run(command, arg1, arg2)`  
**Then** the arguments should be passed to the command's execute method  
**And** the command should process the arguments correctly

#### Scenario: Handle command execution error

**Given** a command that throws an error during execution  
**When** the user calls `context.run(command)`  
**Then** the error should propagate to the caller  
**And** the error should include context about the command that failed

---

### Requirement: File Reference System

The system MUST provide a FileReference object that represents stored file content.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Create file reference with metadata

**Given** a file is created by a workflow operation  
**When** a FileReference is returned  
**Then** the reference should contain the file path  
**And** the reference should contain the timestamp  
**And** the reference should contain the property name

#### Scenario: Load content from file reference

**Given** a FileReference exists  
**When** the user calls `reference.getContent()`  
**Then** the file content should be loaded  
**And** the content should be returned as a string  
**And** the content should be cached for subsequent calls

#### Scenario: Get file path from reference

**Given** a FileReference exists  
**When** the user calls `reference.getPath()`  
**Then** the absolute file path should be returned

#### Scenario: Pass file reference to another operation

**Given** a FileReference from a store operation  
**When** the reference is passed to a transform or load operation  
**Then** the receiving operation should access the file content  
**And** the operation should work correctly with the reference

---

### Requirement: File Naming Convention

The system MUST follow a consistent file naming pattern for all operations.

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Generate file name for store operation

**Given** a property name "userData" and current timestamp  
**When** a store operation creates a file  
**Then** the file name should be `userData.{timestamp}.md`  
**And** the timestamp should be in ISO 8601 or specified format

#### Scenario: Generate file name for load operation

**Given** a file is loaded with name "input.txt"  
**When** the load operation creates a reference  
**Then** the internal reference name should include timestamp  
**And** the format should follow `{original-name}.{timestamp}.md`

#### Scenario: Generate file name for transform operation

**Given** a transform is applied to a reference  
**When** the output file is created  
**Then** the file name should include `.transform.` in the name  
**And** the format should be `{property}.transform.{timestamp}.md`

#### Scenario: Handle special characters in property names

**Given** a property name contains spaces or special characters  
**When** a file name is generated  
**Then** special characters should be sanitized or escaped  
**And** the file name should be valid for the file system

---

### Requirement: Asynchronous Execution

All workflow operations MUST execute asynchronously and return Promises.

**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Store operation is asynchronous

**Given** a WorkflowContext is initialized  
**When** the user calls `context.store(value)`  
**Then** the method should return a Promise  
**And** the Promise should resolve to a FileReference  
**And** the file should be created after the Promise resolves

#### Scenario: Transform operation is asynchronous

**Given** a FileReference and transforms  
**When** the user calls `context.transform(ref, transforms)`  
**Then** the method should return a Promise  
**And** transforms should be applied asynchronously  
**And** the Promise should resolve to a FileReference

#### Scenario: Run operation is asynchronous

**Given** an ICommand instance  
**When** the user calls `context.run(command)`  
**Then** the method should return a Promise  
**And** the command should execute asynchronously  
**And** the Promise should resolve to a FileReference

#### Scenario: Await multiple operations in sequence

**Given** multiple workflow operations  
**When** operations are awaited in sequence  
**Then** each operation should complete before the next starts  
**And** file references should be available for subsequent operations

---

### Requirement: Token Replacement Transform

The system MUST provide a transform that replaces token placeholders with referenced content.

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Replace single token in template

**Given** a string "Hello {{name}}" and a reference with token "name" containing "World"  
**When** the token replacement transform is applied  
**Then** the output should be "Hello World"  
**And** the {{name}} placeholder should be replaced

#### Scenario: Replace multiple tokens in template

**Given** a string "{{greeting}} {{name}}" and references for both tokens  
**When** the token replacement transform is applied  
**Then** all tokens should be replaced with their reference content  
**And** the output should have all placeholders substituted

#### Scenario: Handle missing token reference

**Given** a string "Hello {{name}}" with no reference for "name"  
**When** the token replacement transform is applied  
**Then** the transform should either leave the token or throw an error  
**And** the behavior should be configurable

---

### Requirement: Regex Parsing Transform

The system MUST provide a transform that extracts content using regular expressions.

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Extract single match from content

**Given** a string "Order #12345 processed" and regex pattern `#(\d+)`  
**When** the regex parsing transform is applied  
**Then** the capture group should be extracted  
**And** the output should contain "12345"

#### Scenario: Extract multiple matches from content

**Given** a string with multiple numbers and a regex pattern  
**When** the regex parsing transform is applied with match-all option  
**Then** all matches should be extracted  
**And** the output should be an array or formatted list of matches

#### Scenario: Handle no matches found

**Given** a string that doesn't match the regex pattern  
**When** the regex parsing transform is applied  
**Then** an empty result or error should be returned  
**And** the behavior should be clearly defined

---

### Requirement: ICommand Interface

The system MUST define an ICommand interface that can be implemented for custom commands.

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Implement custom command

**Given** the ICommand interface is available  
**When** a developer creates a class implementing ICommand  
**Then** the class should implement the execute method  
**And** the execute method should accept context and arguments  
**And** the execute method should return Promise<FileReference>

#### Scenario: Access context in command execution

**Given** a command is executing  
**When** the execute method is called with context  
**Then** the command should access context.store()  
**And** the command should access context.load()  
**And** the command should access context.transform()  
**And** the command should call other commands via context.run()

#### Scenario: Return file reference from command

**Given** a command completes execution  
**When** the command returns  
**Then** it should return a FileReference  
**And** the reference should point to a valid output file

---

### Requirement: ITransform Interface

The system MUST define an ITransform interface that can be implemented for custom transforms.

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Functional

#### Scenario: Implement custom transform

**Given** the ITransform interface is available  
**When** a developer creates a class implementing ITransform  
**Then** the class should implement the transform method  
**And** the method should accept content string and context  
**And** the method should accept collection of file references  
**And** the method should return transformed string

#### Scenario: Access references in transform

**Given** a transform is executing with file references  
**When** the transform method processes the content  
**Then** it should access content from the provided references  
**And** it should use the reference content in transformation logic

#### Scenario: Chain multiple custom transforms

**Given** multiple custom transforms are created  
**When** they are passed to context.transform()  
**Then** they should be applied in sequence  
**And** each transform should receive the output of the previous transform

---

### Requirement: Transform Extensibility

The system MUST support adding new transform types without modifying core code.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** Non-Functional

#### Scenario: Add new transform type

**Given** a developer wants to create a new transform  
**When** they implement the ITransform interface  
**Then** the new transform should work with context.transform()  
**And** no changes to core code should be required

#### Scenario: Use built-in and custom transforms together

**Given** built-in and custom transforms exist  
**When** they are passed together to context.transform()  
**Then** both types should work seamlessly  
**And** they should be applied in the specified order

---
