# Change Proposal: Add Workflow Processing

**Change ID:** `add-workflow-processing`  
**Created:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Implement a workflow processing system that enables execution of different processes with context-based function execution and automatic file-based input/output recording. The system supports storing values as file references, loading from files, and applying transforms on memory elements with chainable operations.

## Motivation

Users need a flexible workflow processing system to:
- Execute processes as single functions with shared context
- Run asynchronous functions with automatic I/O recording to text files
- Pass outputs as reference objects to subsequent functions
- Store and retrieve values with automatic file naming and timestamping
- Apply transforms on memory elements with configurable operations
- Chain operations with file references serving as inputs and outputs

## Goals

1. **Context-Based Execution**: Provide a context object to all functions that manages storage, loading, and transforms
2. **Automatic File Recording**: Store all inputs and outputs as timestamped text files with property-based naming
3. **Reference Management**: Return file references from all operations that can be passed to other functions
4. **Transform System**: Support a generic transform interface for string manipulation with multiple transform types
5. **Asynchronous Operations**: All functions execute asynchronously with proper await handling
6. **Storage Metadata**: Track transform history and properties in stored files

## Non-Goals

- Building a visual workflow designer (code-based only)
- Providing a database backend (file-based storage only)
- Managing distributed execution (single-process only)
- Supporting binary file formats (text files only)

## Affected Capabilities

This change introduces the following new capability:

- **workflow-processing**: Context-based workflow execution with storage, loading, transforms, and command running

## What Changes

- Add WorkflowContext class with store, load, transform, and run methods
- Implement file-based storage with timestamp and property name conventions
- Create file reference system for passing data between operations
- Implement transform interface with token replacement, regex parsing, and extensibility
- Add ICommand interface for executable command instances
- Ensure all operations return file references for chaining

## Impact

- Affected specs: New capability `workflow-processing`
- Affected code: New implementation in workflow processing module
- **BREAKING**: None (new feature)

## Open Questions

1. Should transform history be stored in the same file or separate metadata files?
2. What error handling strategy for failed operations in a workflow?
3. Should there be a maximum file size limit for memory elements?
4. Do we need support for concurrent workflow execution?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Context object provides store, load, transform, and run methods
- [ ] All operations automatically create timestamped files with property-based names
- [ ] File references can be passed between operations
- [ ] Transform system supports multiple transform types
- [ ] Transform metadata is preserved in output files
- [ ] ICommand interface can be implemented for custom commands
- [ ] All operations are asynchronous and properly awaited
- [ ] Documentation covers usage and extension patterns

## Related Changes

- Complements `add-cli-framework` by providing workflow processing logic
- Could be integrated with CLI commands for file-based workflows
